# Testing Atlas Formatting 🎨

## How to See the New Formatting

The italics and emoji formatting is **in the system prompts**, so it will only appear when **Atlas responds to your next message**.

---

## 📊 What You'll See

### When you ask Atlas something, it will respond like:

"I can help with that! Here are three paths forward:

1. **Continue our coding discussion** — *Pick up where we left off*
2. **Explore dance and creativity** — *Try something expressive*
3. **Try something completely new** — *Open to anything*

What feels right to you? ✨"

## ✅ The Rendering is Ready

The CSS changes are **already live**:
- **Bold text** → `text-gray-900` (dark, visible)
- *Italic text* → `text-gray-600` (subtle grey)
- Emojis → Render natively

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

**To test, send Atlas a message like:**
- "What can you help me with?"
- "Give me some coding tips"
- "I need help with dance practice"

**Atlas will respond with:**
- ✅ **Bold** for key terms
- ✅ *Italics* for soft emphasis
- ✅ 1-2 emojis for warmth
- ✅ Proper spacing and line breaks

---

## 🔍 Why You Don't See It Yet

The old messages on screen were generated **before** the system prompt update. Only **new messages** from Atlas will have the formatting.

**Think of it like this:**
- Old messages = Plain text (already rendered)
- New messages = Formatted text (will use new guidelines)

---

## 📱 Mobile & Web

Both are ready! The CSS and system prompts are active on:
- ✅ `https://localhost:5175/` (web)
- ✅ `https://192.168.0.10:5175/` (mobile)

Just send a new message to Atlas and you'll see the formatting! 🚀
