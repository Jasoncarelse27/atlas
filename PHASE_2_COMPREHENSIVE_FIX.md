# Phase 2: Natural Flow - Comprehensive Fix

**Goal:** Complete Phase 2 in ONE comprehensive solution (not incremental patches)

## ‚úÖ What's Already Working:
1. ‚úÖ WebRTC settings (echoCancellation, noiseSuppression) - Already in audioHelpers.ts
2. ‚úÖ Audio acknowledgments - Already implemented (`playAcknowledgmentSound()`)
3. ‚úÖ Partial streaming - Already done (MIN_SENTENCE_LENGTH = 15)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Fixing:
1. **MIN_PROCESS_INTERVAL**: 800ms ‚Üí 500ms (ChatGPT-like responsiveness)
2. **Overlap Tolerance**: Add 200ms overlap + 500ms yield threshold
3. **Acknowledgment Timing**: Ensure plays when Claude TTFB starts (not just after processing)

## üéØ ONE Comprehensive Solution:

### Changes Needed:
1. Reduce MIN_PROCESS_INTERVAL from 800ms to 500ms
2. Add overlap tolerance constants
3. Modify interrupt logic to allow 200ms overlap before interrupting
4. Add yield threshold (500ms) - if user speaks for 500ms, Atlas yields
5. Play acknowledgment sound when Claude TTFB starts (thinking phase)

**Impact:** Transforms walkie-talkie feel ‚Üí natural conversation flow

**Risk:** Low - All changes are timing adjustments, no breaking changes
