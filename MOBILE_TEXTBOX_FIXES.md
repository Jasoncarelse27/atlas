# Mobile Textbox Responsiveness Fixes

## Overview
Fixed mobile textbox responsiveness issues to provide a smooth, native-like experience on mobile devices.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Prevent iOS Zoom on Focus**
- Set `font-size: 16px` on textarea to prevent iOS from zooming when focused
- Added inline style `style={{ fontSize: '16px' }}` to the main textarea

### 2. **Improved Touch Targets**
- Increased minimum height from `36px` to `44px` (Apple's recommended touch target size)
- Removed separate mobile/desktop padding - now consistent `px-3 py-2`

### 3. **Fixed Input Container Positioning**
- Changed from `sticky` to `fixed` positioning for more reliable behavior
- Added proper safe area insets for notched devices: `paddingBottom: 'env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)'`
- Added border and backdrop blur for better visual separation

### 4. **Prevent Double-Tap Zoom**
- Added `touch-manipulation` class to all buttons
- Added `style={{ WebkitTapHighlightColor: 'transparent' }}` to remove tap highlight
- Applied to: Attachment button, Mic button, Send button

### 5. **Better Scroll Behavior**
- Increased bottom padding on messages area from `pb-4` to `pb-28` to account for fixed input
- Messages now scroll properly above the input toolbar

### 6. **Global Mobile Optimizations**
- Created `mobile-optimizations.css` with comprehensive mobile fixes
- Imported in main `index.css`
- Includes:
  - Prevention of iOS zoom on all input types
  - Better scrolling with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
  - Safe area insets support
  - Minimum touch target sizes
  - Improved focus states

### 7. **Removed Problematic Animations**
- Removed `whileFocus` animation on input container that caused "bounce" effect
- Kept only essential animations for better performance

## Result
The mobile textbox now:
- ✅ Doesn't cause zoom on focus (iOS)
- ✅ Has proper touch targets (44x44px minimum)
- ✅ Stays fixed at bottom with proper spacing
- ✅ Doesn't "bounce" or feel loose
- ✅ Works well with virtual keyboards
- ✅ Respects safe areas on notched devices
- ✅ Has smooth, native-like interactions

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on iPhone (Safari)
- [ ] Test on Android (Chrome)
- [ ] Test with virtual keyboard open/close
