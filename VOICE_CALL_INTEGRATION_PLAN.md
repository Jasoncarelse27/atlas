# üìã VOICE CALL INTEGRATION PLAN - ATLAS

## **CURRENT STATE:**
‚úÖ Conversation history working  
‚úÖ Scalability optimized  
‚úÖ Console logging cleaned up  
‚úÖ Delete functionality fixed  

---

## **VOICE CALL FEATURE - STRATEGIC PLAN**

### **TIER RESTRICTIONS (Already Defined):**
```typescript
tierFeatures = {
  free: {
    voiceCallsEnabled: false,
    voiceCallMaxDuration: 0
  },
  core: {
    voiceCallsEnabled: true,
    voiceCallMaxDuration: 300 // 5 minutes
  },
  studio: {
    voiceCallsEnabled: true,
    voiceCallMaxDuration: -1 // Unlimited
  }
}
```

## **EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE:**

### **Already Built:**
1. ‚úÖ `src/services/voiceCallService.ts` - Voice call logic
2. ‚úÖ `src/components/modals/VoiceCallModal.tsx` - UI modal
3. ‚úÖ Tier access hooks (`useTierAccess`, `useFeatureAccess`)
4. ‚úÖ Audio usage tracking
5. ‚úÖ OpenAI Whisper integration (STT)
6. ‚úÖ OpenAI TTS integration

### **What Needs Verification:**
1. Does voice call modal open?
2. Does recording work?
3. Does STT (speech-to-text) work?
4. Does AI response generation work?
5. Does TTS (text-to-speech) work?
6. Are tier restrictions enforced?
7. Is conversation properly saved?

## **INTEGRATION STEPS:**

### **Phase 1: VERIFICATION (30 min)**
- [ ] Test existing voice call flow end-to-end
- [ ] Identify what's broken vs what works
- [ ] Check tier enforcement
- [ ] Verify conversation saving

### **Phase 2: FIX ONLY WHAT'S BROKEN (1-2 hours)**
- [ ] Fix critical bugs only
- [ ] Don't rebuild what works
- [ ] Test incrementally

### **Phase 3: TIER INTEGRATION (30 min)**
- [ ] Verify free users see upgrade prompt
- [ ] Verify core users get 5-minute limit
- [ ] Verify studio users get unlimited

### **Phase 4: POLISH (optional)**
- [ ] UI improvements
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Loading states

## **RISKS TO AVOID:**
‚ùå Don't rebuild the entire voice system  
‚ùå Don't touch working conversation history  
‚ùå Don't over-engineer  
‚ùå Don't add features not in spec  

---

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
‚úÖ Core users can make 5-minute voice calls  
‚úÖ Studio users get unlimited calls  
‚úÖ Free users see upgrade prompt  
‚úÖ Calls save to conversation history  
‚úÖ Audio transcripts work  

---

## **ESTIMATED TIME:**
- Verification: 30 minutes
- Fixes: 1-2 hours
- Testing: 30 minutes
- **Total: 2-3 hours**

---

## **BUDGET IMPACT:**
- OpenAI Whisper: $0.006/minute
- OpenAI TTS: $0.015/1K characters
- For 100 users √ó 10 calls/month √ó 3 min avg:
  - STT cost: $18/month
  - TTS cost: ~$30/month
  - **Total: ~$50/month for voice**

---

## **NEXT STEP:**

**Option A:** Test existing voice call now - see what works  
**Option B:** Review voice call code first - understand architecture  
**Option C:** Plan tier enforcement strategy - make sure limits work  

**Which option?**
