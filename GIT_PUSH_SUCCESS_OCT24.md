**Commit Message:**

feat: Phase 2A - Message deletion with soft delete and cross-device sync

✨ Features:
- Add right-click context menu for user messages (WhatsApp-style)
- Implement delete modal with 2 options: 'Delete for me' and 'Delete for everyone'
- Add 48-hour time limit for 'Delete for everyone' option
- Use professional Ban icon instead of emoji for deleted message placeholder
- Real-time sync across devices with UPDATE listener
- Works on both web (right-click) and mobile (long-press)

🔧 Technical Implementation:
- Soft delete pattern with deleted_at and deleted_by columns
- Real-time UPDATE listener for instant cross-device deletion sync
- Comprehensive sync path fixes (5 different paths now respect deletedAt)
- Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Message status indicators (sent/delivered/read)

🐛 Bug Fixes:
- Fix: Messages no longer reappear after page refresh
- Fix: ChatPage initial load now syncs deleted_at field
- Fix: Real-time INSERT listener syncs deleted_at field
- Fix: ConversationSyncService delta sync respects deletions
- Fix: SyncService full sync respects deletions
- Fix: LoadMessages filters out deleted messages on load

📱 Mobile Support:
- Full mobile compatibility (IndexedDB + Supabase Realtime)
- Touch-friendly long-press for context menu
- Responsive delete modal
- Cross-device sync works seamlessly

🗄️ Database:
- Add migration: deleted_at and deleted_by columns to messages table
- Add performance indexes for filtering deleted messages
- Preserves audit trail with soft delete
```

## 📋 **POST-PUSH CHECKLIST**

### **Immediate Actions:**
- [x] Code pushed to main branch

### **Database Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor (Production)
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250124_message_deletion_support.sql

ALTER TABLE public.messages 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

ALTER TABLE public.messages 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS deleted_by TEXT CHECK (deleted_by IN ('user', 'everyone'));

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_deleted_at_filter
ON public.messages (deleted_at) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_user_deleted
ON public.messages (user_id, deleted_at);
```

**Note:** Migration is SAFE to run (uses `IF NOT EXISTS`)
