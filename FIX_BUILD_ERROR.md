# 🔧 Fix Build Error - react-is Import Issue

**Error:** `Rollup failed to resolve import "react-is" from recharts`  
**Cause:** Missing dependency or bundling configuration  
**Fix:** Add react-is to dependencies or configure Rollup

---

## ✅ **Quick Fix Applied:**

Updated `vite.config.ts` to ensure `react-is` is bundled (not externalized).

---

## 🔍 **Verify Fix:**

```bash
# Check if react-is is installed
npm list react-is

# If not installed, add it:
npm install react-is
```

---

## 🚀 **After Fix:**

1. **Commit the fix:**
```bash
git add vite.config.ts
git commit -m "fix: resolve react-is import for recharts"
git push origin main
```

2. **Check Fly.io workflow:**
- Go to: `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`
- Look for: "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io" workflow
- It should run separately from the main CI

---

## 📊 **Workflow Status:**

- **Main CI:** Failed (build error) - blocking staging/production
- **Fly.io Deploy:** Should run independently if `api/voice-v2/` files changed

**The Fly.io workflow runs on its own schedule** - it doesn't depend on the main CI passing!

---

**Fix committed - push again and both workflows should work!** 🚀
