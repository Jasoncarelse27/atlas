## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test Environment Setup**
```bash
# 1. Start the dev server
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0

# 2. Access Atlas
# Desktop: http://localhost:5174
# Mobile: http://192.168.0.229:5174
```

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: Free Tier User (Audio Restricted)**
1. **Setup**: Login with a Free tier user
2. **Action**: Click the + button → Click mic button
3. **Expected**: 
   - ✅ Upgrade alert: "🎤 Voice recording is available for Core/Studio users. Upgrade to unlock audio features!"
   - ✅ No recording interface appears
   - ✅ No audio events logged

#### **Scenario 2: Core/Studio User (Audio Enabled)**
1. **Setup**: Login with a Core or Studio tier user
2. **Action**: Click the + button → Click mic button
3. **Expected**:
   - ✅ Voice input overlay appears
   - ✅ Red recording button with timer
   - ✅ Microphone permission request
   - ✅ Recording starts successfully

#### **Scenario 3: Complete Audio Flow**
1. **Setup**: Core/Studio user with microphone access
2. **Actions**:
   - Click mic button → Voice overlay appears
   - Click red button → Recording starts (timer shows)
   - Click square button → Recording stops
   - Wait for transcription
3. **Expected**:
   - ✅ Recording timer increments (0:01, 0:02, etc.)
   - ✅ "Processing..." appears after stopping
   - ✅ Transcribed text appears as user message
   - ✅ AI responds to transcription
   - ✅ Voice overlay closes automatically
   - ✅ Audio events logged in Supabase

#### **Scenario 4: Error Handling**
1. **Setup**: Core/Studio user
2. **Actions**: 
   - Deny microphone permission when prompted
   - OR: Try recording with no microphone
3. **Expected**:
   - ✅ Error message: "Microphone access denied. Please allow microphone permissions."
   - ✅ No recording starts
   - ✅ Error event logged

#### **Scenario 5: Network/STT Errors**
1. **Setup**: Core/Studio user with microphone
2. **Action**: Record audio when STT service is unavailable
3. **Expected**:
   - ✅ Error message: "Failed to process audio. Please try again."
   - ✅ Failure event logged
   - ✅ Graceful fallback (no app crash)

## 📊 **Analytics Verification**

### **Database Events to Check**
```sql
-- Check audio events in Supabase
SELECT 
  event_type,
  tier,
  metadata,
  created_at
FROM audio_events 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Expected Event Types**
- `recording_start` - When user starts recording
- `recording_stop` - When user stops recording  
- `transcription_success` - When STT succeeds
- `transcription_fail` - When STT fails

---

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

### **Console Logs to Monitor**
```javascript
// AudioService logs
[AudioService] Starting transcription for user: [user-id]
[AudioService] Audio blob size: [size] bytes
[AudioService] Transcription successful: [text]
[AudioService] Audio event logged successfully

// VoiceInputWeb logs
[VoiceInputWeb] Audio processing error: [error]
```

### **Network Requests to Check**
- **STT Request**: `POST /functions/v1/stt`
- **Audio Events**: `INSERT INTO audio_events`
- **Chat Message**: `POST /message` (after transcription)
