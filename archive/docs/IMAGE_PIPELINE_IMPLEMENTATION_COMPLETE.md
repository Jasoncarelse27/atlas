# 🖼️ Atlas AI Image Pipeline - Implementation Complete

**Date:** September 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Image Service (`src/services/imageService.ts`)**
- ✅ **Image Picker**: `pickImage()` - Gallery access with permissions
- ✅ **Image Compression**: `compressImage()` - Resize to 1080px, 70% quality
- ✅ **Upload to Supabase**: `uploadImage()` - Secure storage in `uploads` bucket
- ✅ **Claude Analysis**: `uploadAndAnalyze()` - Full pipeline integration
- ✅ **Analytics Logging**: Complete event tracking (upload_start, upload_success, scan_success, etc.)

### **2. Chat Service Integration (`src/services/chatService.ts`)**
- ✅ **sendImage()**: New method for Claude Vision API calls
- ✅ **Backend Integration**: Sends imageUrl + user text to `/message` endpoint
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for analysis failures

### **3. UI Integration (`src/features/chat/components/ChatInputBar.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Image Button**: 📷 in expandable + menu
- ✅ **Tier Gating**: Free users get upgrade prompt
- ✅ **Loading States**: Spinner during upload/analysis
- ✅ **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- ✅ **Input Integration**: Uses text input as analysis context

### **4. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/`)**
- ✅ **image_events Table**: Complete analytics tracking
- ✅ **RLS Policies**: User-only access to their events
- ✅ **Storage Bucket**: `uploads` bucket with proper permissions
- ✅ **File Metadata**: Tracks file_path, file_size, timestamps

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

```
User taps 📷 → pickImage() → compressImage() → uploadImage() → 
Claude Vision Analysis → Chat Response → Analytics Logging
```

### **Key Features:**
- **Anthropic-Only**: Uses Claude Opus for image analysis
- **Secure Storage**: Supabase Storage with RLS
- **Tier Enforcement**: Core/Studio only, Free gets upgrade prompt
- **Analytics Ready**: Full event tracking for business insights
- **Error Resilient**: Graceful handling of upload/analysis failures

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Core/Studio Users:**
- [ ] Tap 📷 → Image picker opens
- [ ] Select image → Uploads to Supabase Storage
- [ ] Image gets analyzed by Claude
- [ ] Analysis appears in chat
- [ ] Analytics events logged in `image_events` table

### **Free Users:**
- [ ] Tap 📷 → Upgrade prompt appears
- [ ] No image picker opens
- [ ] No storage/analysis occurs

### **Error Cases:**
- [ ] Upload failure → Error toast shown
- [ ] Analysis failure → Graceful fallback
- [ ] Permission denied → Clear error message

## 📊 **Analytics Events Tracked**

| Event | Description | Metadata |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `image_upload_start` | User selects image | `fileUri` |
| `image_upload_complete` | Successfully uploaded | `filePath`, `fileSize` |
| `image_upload_fail` | Upload failed | `error` |
| `image_scan_request` | Sent to Claude | `model: "claude-opus"` |
| `image_scan_success` | Analysis complete | `chars_output` |
| `image_scan_fail` | Analysis failed | `reason` |
