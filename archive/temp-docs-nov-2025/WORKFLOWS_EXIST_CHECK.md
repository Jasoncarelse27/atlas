## 🔍 **Why They Might Not Show in GitHub:**

### **Reason 1: Not Committed Yet**

**Check if committed:**
```bash
git status .github/workflows/fly-io-deploy.yml
```

**If shows "modified" or "untracked":**
- Need to commit and push

---

### **Reason 2: GitHub Needs Refresh**

**Try:**
1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Wait 10-30 seconds
3. Scroll down in left sidebar

---

## 🚀 **Make Them Appear:**

### **If Not Committed:**

```bash
# Commit the workflows
git add .github/workflows/fly-io-deploy.yml .github/workflows/test-fly-secret.yml
git commit -m "feat: add Fly.io deployment and test workflows"
git push origin main
```

**Then:**
1. Refresh GitHub Actions page
2. Workflows will appear in left sidebar
3. Can run them!

---

## 📍 **Where to Find Them:**

**After committing:**
- Go to: `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`
- **Left sidebar** → Scroll to find:
  - "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io"
  - "Test Fly.io Secret"

**Or search:**
- Use search bar: type "Fly"

---

## ✅ **Quick Test:**

**Run this to check status:**
```bash
git status .github/workflows/
```

**If files show as new/modified:**
- Commit them first
- Then they'll appear in GitHub Actions

---

**The workflows exist - they just need to be committed to show up in GitHub!** 📝
