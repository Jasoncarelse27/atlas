# 🔄 Fly.io Deployment Workflow

**Current Status:** Manual deployment required  
**Options:** Manual (now) or Automatic (CI/CD)

---

## ❓ **Current Answer: No, Changes Don't Auto-Deploy**

**Right now:** You need to manually deploy after making changes:

```bash
cd api/voice-v2
./deploy-multi-region.sh
```

**Why:** Fly.io requires `flyctl` commands, which aren't set up in GitHub Actions yet.

---

## ✅ **Option 1: Manual Deployment (Current)**

### **Workflow:**
```
1. Make changes locally
   ↓
2. Test locally
   ↓
3. Commit & push to GitHub
   ↓
4. Manually run: ./deploy-multi-region.sh
   ↓
5. Changes deploy to Fly.io
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Can test before deploying
- ✅ No accidental deployments

**Cons:**
- ❌ Must remember to deploy
- ❌ Extra step after git push

---

## 🚀 **Option 2: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**

### **Setup GitHub Actions for Auto-Deploy**

**Workflow:**
```
1. Make changes locally
   ↓
2. Commit & push to GitHub
   ↓
3. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Builds Docker image
   - Deploys to Fly.io (both regions)
   - Runs health checks
   ↓
4. Changes live on Fly.io ✅
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automatic deployment
- ✅ Zero manual steps
- ✅ Deploys on every push

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to set up GitHub Actions
- ⚠️ Need Fly.io token in GitHub Secrets

---

## 🔧 **Setting Up Automatic Deployment**

### **Step 1: Get Fly.io Token**

```bash
# Generate deploy token
flyctl tokens create deploy -x 999999h
```

**Save this token** - you'll need it for GitHub Secrets.

### **Step 2: Add GitHub Secret**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/atlas/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `FLY_API_TOKEN`
4. Value: (paste token from Step 1)
5. Click "Add secret"

### **Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow**

I'll create this for you - it will:
- Deploy on push to `main` branch
- Deploy to both US and EU regions
- Run health checks
- Show deployment status

## 📊 **Comparison**

| Method | Steps | Time | Best For |
|--------|-------|------|----------|
| **Manual** | 5 steps | 2-3 min | Testing, controlled releases |
| **Automatic** | 2 steps | 0 min | Fast iteration, CI/CD |

---

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**For Voice V2:** Set up automatic deployment
- ✅ Fast iteration (important for voice feature)
- ✅ No manual steps
- ✅ Deploys on every push

**Want me to set it up?** I can create the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic Fly.io deployment!
