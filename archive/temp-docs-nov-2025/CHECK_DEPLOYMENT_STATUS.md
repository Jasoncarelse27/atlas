# 🔍 How to Check if Fly.io Deployment Worked

**Current Status:** Need to verify deployment

---

## ✅ **Step 1: Check GitHub Actions**

**Go to:** `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`

**Look for:** "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io" workflow

**In the left sidebar, scroll through workflows:**
- If you see "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io" → Click it to see status
- If you DON'T see it → It hasn't triggered yet

**Status meanings:**
- ✅ **Green checkmark** = Successfully deployed
- ❌ **Red X** = Deployment failed (check logs)
- ⏳ **Yellow circle** = Currently deploying

---

## ✅ **Step 2: Test Health Endpoint**

**Run in your terminal:**
```bash
curl https://atlas-voice-v2.fly.dev/health
```

**If deployed:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","activeSessions":0,...}
```

**If NOT deployed:**
- Connection refused
- 404 Not Found
- Timeout

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Check Machines (if logged in)**

**Run:**
```bash
flyctl machines list --app atlas-voice-v2
```

**If deployed, should show:**
```
2 machines:
- Machine 1: iad (Washington DC) - started
- Machine 2: fra (Frankfurt) - started
```

---

## 🎯 **Most Likely Status:**

Based on what I see:
- ❌ **Fly.io workflow probably hasn't run yet**
- The workflow only triggers when `api/voice-v2/` files change
- OR needs manual trigger

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Option 1: Trigger Manually (Fastest)**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`
2. Click: "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io" (in left sidebar)
3. Click: "Run workflow" button (top right)
4. Select: `main` branch
5. Click: "Run workflow"

**Then watch it deploy!** 🎉

### **Option 2: Make a Change to Trigger**

```bash
cd api/voice-v2
echo "# Deployment trigger" >> server.mjs
git add api/voice-v2/server.mjs
git commit -m "chore: trigger Fly.io deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

## 📊 **Summary:**

- ✅ **Setup complete:** Token added, workflow ready
- ⏳ **Deployment:** Needs trigger (manual or file change)
- ✅ **Build fix:** Applied (react-is)

**Go trigger the workflow manually - that's the fastest way!** 🚀
