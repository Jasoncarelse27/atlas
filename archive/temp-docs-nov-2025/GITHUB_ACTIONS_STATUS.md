# 📊 GitHub Actions Status - What's Happening

**Current Status:** Main CI failed, but Fly.io workflow runs independently

---

## 🔍 **What You're Seeing:**

### **Main CI Pipeline (`atlas-unified-ci-cd.yml`):**
- ❌ **Failed:** "Build, Lint & Test" job
- ✅ **Passed:** Security, Database, Staging, Production, Rollback (skipped)

**Errors:**
1. **Build Error:** `react-is` import resolution (recharts dependency)
2. **Test Errors:** Playwright and RetryService tests (existing issues)

---

## ✅ **Good News: Fly.io Workflow is Separate!**

The **Fly.io deployment workflow** (`fly-io-deploy.yml`) runs **independently** when:
- Files in `api/voice-v2/` change
- OR workflow is manually triggered

**It doesn't depend on the main CI passing!**

---

## 🔧 **Fix Applied:**

Updated `vite.config.ts` to fix `react-is` bundling issue.

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **1. Check if Fly.io Workflow Ran:**

Go to: `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`

Look for workflow: **"Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io"**

- ✅ If it ran → Check its status
- ❌ If it didn't run → Need to trigger it

### **2. If Fly.io Workflow Didn't Run:**

**Option A: Manual Trigger**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Option B: Make a Change to Trigger It**
```bash
cd api/voice-v2
echo "# Trigger Fly.io deploy" >> server.mjs
git add api/voice-v2/server.mjs
git commit -m "chore: trigger Fly.io deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

## 📊 **Summary:**

- ✅ **Fly.io token:** Added to GitHub Secrets
- ✅ **Fly.io workflow:** Created and ready
- ⚠️ **Main CI:** Has build errors (but doesn't block Fly.io)
- ⏳ **Fly.io deploy:** May need manual trigger or file change

---

## 🎯 **Quick Action:**

**Check if Fly.io workflow ran:**
- Go to: `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`
- Look for: "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io"
- If not there → Trigger it manually or make a change to `api/voice-v2/`

---

**The build errors are separate - Fly.io deployment can still work!** 🚀
