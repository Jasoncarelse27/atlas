# 🚀 Fly.io Launch Options - Which to Choose?

**You're on:** `fly.io/dashboard/personal/new-launch`  
**Two Options:** Launch from GitHub vs Launch from your machine

---

## 🎯 **Which Option for Atlas Voice V2?**

### **✅ Choose: "Launch from your machine"**

**Why:**
- ✅ We already have GitHub Actions set up
- ✅ We want to deploy `api/voice-v2` specifically
- ✅ We need multi-region deployment
- ✅ We have a custom `fly.toml` configuration

**"Launch from GitHub" is for:**
- Simple apps with no custom config
- Single-region deployments
- Apps that Fly.io can auto-detect

**"Launch from your machine" is for:**
- Custom configurations (like ours)
- Multi-region deployments
- Apps with specific setup (like Voice V2)

---

## 📝 **Steps: Launch from Your Machine**

### **1. Click "Launch from your machine" tab**

### **2. Follow the instructions:**

Fly.io will show you commands like:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/app
flyctl launch
```

### **3. For Voice V2, use our directory:**

```bash
cd api/voice-v2
flyctl launch
```

**What `flyctl launch` does:**
- Detects your `fly.toml` config
- Creates the app (`atlas-voice-v2`)
- Sets up deployment
- Optionally deploys (you can skip first deploy)

---

## 🔄 **OR: Use Our Script (Faster)**

### **Even Easier - Use our deploy script:**

```bash
cd api/voice-v2
./deploy-multi-region.sh
```

**This script:**
- ✅ Creates app if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Sets secrets
- ✅ Deploys to US region
- ✅ Clones to EU region
- ✅ Runs health checks

**One command does everything!** 🚀

## 🎯 **Recommended Path**

### **Option A: Use Fly.io Dashboard (Easier)**

1. **Click "Launch from your machine"**
2. **Follow Fly.io's instructions**
3. **It will create the app automatically**
4. **Then go back to token page** → app will be in dropdown ✅

### **Option B: Use Our Script (Faster)**

```bash
cd api/voice-v2
./deploy-multi-region.sh
```

**This does everything:**
- Creates app
- Sets secrets
- Deploys to both regions
- Sets up automatic deployment

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### **If you use Fly.io Dashboard:**

- ✅ It will create the app
- ⚠️ You still need to set secrets manually
- ⚠️ You still need to deploy to EU region manually
- ⚠️ You still need to add GitHub token for auto-deploy

### **If you use our script:**

- ✅ Creates app
- ✅ Sets all secrets
- ✅ Deploys to both regions
- ✅ Everything configured

---

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Use our script** - it's faster and sets everything up:

```bash
cd api/voice-v2
chmod +x deploy-multi-region.sh
./deploy-multi-region.sh
```

**Then:**
1. Go to token page → app will exist ✅
2. Create token
3. Add to GitHub Secrets
4. Done! Auto-deploy will work 🎉

---

## 📋 **Quick Decision Tree**

**Want it all automated?**
→ Use `./deploy-multi-region.sh`

**Want to learn Fly.io step-by-step?**
→ Use "Launch from your machine" in dashboard

**Already have app created?**
→ Go directly to token page

**Which would you like to do?** I recommend the script - it's faster! 🚀
