# 🔍 Fly.io Deployment Verification

**Status:** Checking if deployment worked

---

## ✅ **Check Fly.io Workflow Status:**

### **Go to GitHub Actions:**

**URL:** `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`

**Look for workflow:** "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io"

**If you see it:**
- ✅ **Green checkmark** = Deployed successfully
- ❌ **Red X** = Deployment failed (check logs)
- ⏳ **Yellow circle** = In progress

**If you DON'T see it:**
- The workflow hasn't triggered yet
- It only triggers when files in `api/voice-v2/` change
- OR you can trigger it manually

---

## 🔧 **Build Error Fix:**

I've installed `react-is` dependency and updated `vite.config.ts` to fix the build error.

**Changes made:**
- ✅ Installed `react-is` package
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to bundle react-is

**Next:** Commit and push to trigger deployment

## 🚀 **Trigger Fly.io Deployment:**

### **Option 1: Manual Trigger (Easiest)**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Jasoncarelse27/atlas/actions`
2. Click: "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io" (left sidebar)
3. Click: "Run workflow" button
4. Select: `main` branch
5. Click: "Run workflow"

### **Option 2: Commit Changes**

```bash
# Commit the fixes
git add vite.config.ts package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: resolve react-is import and trigger Fly.io deploy"
git push origin main
```

**This will:**
- Fix the build error
- Trigger Fly.io deployment (if files in `api/voice-v2/` changed)
- Trigger main CI (should pass now)

---

## 📊 **Status Summary:**

- ✅ **Token:** Added to GitHub Secrets
- ✅ **Workflow:** Created and ready
- ✅ **Build fix:** Applied (react-is installed)
- ⏳ **Deployment:** Needs trigger (manual or via commit)

---

## 🎯 **Quick Action:**

**Best approach:**
1. Commit the build fixes
2. Manually trigger Fly.io workflow
3. Watch both workflows run

**Or just trigger Fly.io workflow manually** - it doesn't need the build fix to deploy!
