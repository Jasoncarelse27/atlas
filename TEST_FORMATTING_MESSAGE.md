# Test Message for Atlas Formatting

Copy and paste this into the Atlas chat to see the formatting in action:

---

## Test Message (Copy This):

```
I'd love to help you explore your interests! Here are **three paths** we could take:

1. **Continue coding** â€” *Build on what we've been discussing*
2. **Dance practice** â€” *Work on technique and creativity*
3. **Something new** â€” *Explore a fresh topic together*

What feels right to you? âœ¨
```

---

## What You'll See:

- **Bold text** (dark grey, `text-gray-900`)
- *Italic text* (subtle grey, `text-gray-600`)
- âœ¨ Emoji at the end
- Proper spacing between items

---

## Or Try This Markdown Test:

```
Here's how the new formatting looks:

**Bold text** for important terms
*Italic text* for gentle emphasis  
Regular text for normal content

And we can add an emoji at the end! ðŸ’¡
```

## Quick HTML Test (For Manual Testing):

If you want to test the CSS directly, you can inspect this in browser DevTools:

```html
<strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Bold Text</strong>
<em class="italic text-gray-600">Italic Text</em>
```

The CSS is **already live** on web at `https://localhost:5175/` - you just need Atlas to send a formatted response to see it render!
