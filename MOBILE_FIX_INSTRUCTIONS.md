# 🔧 MOBILE FIX - FINAL STEPS

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **CSS Import Issue**
   - Added `@import './features/rituals/styles/mobile.css';` to `src/index.css`
   - Mobile styles now load globally

2. **Multiple Dev Servers Running**
   - Cleaned up background processes
   - Was causing port conflicts

## 🚀 TO START THE APP:

```bash
cd /Users/jasoncarelse/atlas
npm run dev
```

Then open: **https://localhost:5174/rituals**

## 📱 TO TEST ON MOBILE:

### Option 1: Desktop Browser (Quick Test)
1. Open https://localhost:5174/rituals
2. Press `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) or `F12` (Windows)
3. Click mobile icon or press `Cmd + Shift + M`
4. Select "iPhone 14 Pro"
5. Reload page

### Option 2: Real Phone (Full Test)
1. Make sure phone is on same WiFi
2. On phone, open: `https://192.168.0.10:5174/rituals`
3. Accept SSL certificate warning
4. Test features

## 🐛 IF MOBILE STILL "NOT WORKING":

**Please tell me specifically:**
1. ❓ What device/browser are you using?
2. ❓ What exactly happens? 
   - Blank screen?
   - Page loads but buttons don't work?
   - Styles look broken?
   - Specific feature not working?
3. ❓ Any errors in browser console? (F12 → Console tab)
4. ❓ Testing on real phone or desktop simulating mobile?

## ✅ KNOWN WORKING FEATURES:

- Pull-to-refresh gesture
- Haptic feedback on actions
- Touch targets (48px+)
- Loading skeletons
- iOS safe area (notch support)
- Swipe gestures in ritual runner

## 📊 FILES CHANGED:

**All changes are committed and ready to test!**
