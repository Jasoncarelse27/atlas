## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Microphone access denied"
**Solution:** Grant microphone permissions in your browser
- **Chrome:** Settings ‚Üí Privacy and security ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Microphone
- **Safari:** Preferences ‚Üí Websites ‚Üí Microphone
- **Mobile:** Settings ‚Üí Safari/Chrome ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow

### "Audio recording not supported in this browser"
**Solution:** Update your browser to the latest version or switch to a supported browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox)

### "Connection lost, retrying..."
**Solution:** Check your internet connection. Atlas will automatically retry 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s). If all retries fail, end the call and try again.

### Voice calls don't work on mobile
**Solution:** Ensure you're accessing Atlas via HTTPS (secure connection). HTTP connections cannot access microphone on mobile devices due to browser security policies.

**Options:**
1. Use desktop browser (works with HTTP)
2. Set up HTTPS with ngrok or mkcert (see mobile access guide)
3. Access via production URL (already HTTPS)

### Call ends unexpectedly
**Possible causes:**
- 30-minute maximum duration reached (Studio: unlimited daily, but 30min per call)
- Network connection lost
- Browser tab closed or refreshed

**Solution:** Simply start a new call - your conversation history is preserved

### Atlas doesn't understand me
**Solutions:**
- Speak more clearly and slowly
- Reduce background noise
- Check your microphone quality
- Ensure microphone is not muted
- Try rephrasing your question
