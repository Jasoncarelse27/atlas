# üö® STATUS - End of Day Oct 30, 2025

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED (Ready to Commit)

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes
- ‚úÖ **Fixed messages disappearing on refresh** - `databaseMigration.ts` was clearing all data
- ‚úÖ **Fixed "View Insights" button** - Now goes to `/ritual-insights` instead of `/chat`
- ‚úÖ **Updated Claude model names** - Using `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (old model retired Oct 29)
- ‚úÖ **Increased max_tokens** - From 512 to 2000 to allow proper responses

### 2. Files Changed
**Backend:**
- `backend/services/messageService.js` - Model names + max_tokens
- `backend/server.mjs` - Model names
- `backend/config/intelligentTierSystem.mjs` - Model names

**Frontend:**
- `src/services/databaseMigration.ts` - Removed data clearing
- `src/features/rituals/components/RitualRunView.tsx` - Fixed insights navigation
- `src/features/rituals/components/RitualBuilder.tsx` - Added smart suggestions imports

**New Files:**
- `src/features/rituals/services/ritualSuggestions.ts` - Smart ritual building AI

## ‚ùå STILL BROKEN - Need to Fix Tomorrow

### Issue: Backend Returns Errors
**Symptom:** Atlas responds with "Sorry, I hit an error generating the response."

**Backend Logs Show:**
```
[Server] ‚ùå Claude streaming error
Error: Anthropic API Error: {"type":"error","error":{"type":"not_found_error","message":"model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"}}
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Model name is still wrong (even though we tested it)
2. Backend not restarted with new code
3. API key issue
4. Network/proxy issue

**Backend Process:**
- PID: 82975
- Port: https://localhost:8000
- Status: Running but returning errors

## üîç TOMORROW'S TODO

### Priority 1: Fix Backend Errors
1. Check if backend is actually using the updated code
2. Verify the correct Claude model name (may have changed again)
3. Test direct API call to Anthropic to verify model
4. Check for any caching issues

### Priority 2: Test Fixes
1. Verify messages persist on page refresh
2. Verify "View Insights" goes to correct page
3. Test ritual creation flow

### Priority 3: Cleanup
1. Delete test files (`test_models.mjs`, `scripts/test-ritual-save.js`, etc.)
2. Review and finalize ritual suggestions feature

IMPROVEMENTS:
- Added smart ritual suggestions service with AI-powered recommendations
- Better ritual builder UX with intelligent suggestions

- backend/services/messageService.js
- backend/server.mjs

## ü§î QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW

1. Why is the model `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` not found when we tested it successfully?
2. Is there a caching layer we're not clearing?
3. Should we add a fallback to the old working model?
4. Do we need to update the Anthropic SDK version?

---

## üîß QUICK DEBUG COMMANDS FOR TOMORROW

```bash
# Check if backend is using new code
grep -r "claude-sonnet-4-5" backend/

# Test model directly
node test_models.mjs

# Restart backend fresh
kill -9 82975
cd backend && node server.mjs &

# Check backend logs
tail -f /tmp/atlas-backend.log
```

---

## üí° LEARNINGS TODAY

1. Always check deprecation dates for AI models
2. Database migrations should NEVER clear data automatically
3. Model names can retire with very short notice (Oct 29!)
4. Test actual API responses, not just code changes

---

**Jason - Get some rest. We'll fix the backend error first thing tomorrow morning. The critical bugs (messages disappearing + navigation) are fixed in the code, we just need to get the backend working properly.**
