## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (In Priority Order)

### **1. Create Products in FastSpring** (5 minutes - REQUIRED)

Go to FastSpring Dashboard → **Catalog** → Create 2 products:

**Product 1: Core Plan**
```
Product ID: atlas-core-monthly
Display Name: Atlas Core Monthly
Price: $19.99 USD
Billing: Monthly recurring
Type: Subscription
```

**Product 2: Studio Plan**
```
Product ID: atlas-studio-monthly
Display Name: Atlas Studio Monthly
Price: $189.99 USD
Billing: Monthly recurring
Type: Subscription
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Product IDs must match exactly: `atlas-core-monthly` and `atlas-studio-monthly`

---

### **2. Test Locally** (10 minutes)

```bash
# Start dev server
cd /Users/jasoncarelse/atlas
npm run dev

# Test flow:
# 1. Login as a user
# 2. Click "Upgrade to Core" button
# 3. Should redirect to REAL FastSpring checkout
# 4. Complete test purchase (use FastSpring test card)
# 5. Verify user gets upgraded to Core tier
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Redirects to FastSpring checkout (not mock)
- ✅ Shows $19.99/month for Core
- ✅ Shows $189.99/month for Studio
- ✅ Webhook updates user tier in database
- ✅ User can access Core/Studio features

---

### **3. Deploy to Production** (When ready)

```bash
# Railway will auto-deploy on git push
git push origin main

# Or manually trigger:
railway up
```

**Environment Variables Needed in Railway:**
- All `FASTSPRING_*` variables from `.env.production`
- Already set in `.env.production` file
