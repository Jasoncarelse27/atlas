# 🎉 Voice Call FINAL FIX - MediaRecorder Timeslice Bug

## 🐛 The Bug

**Problem**: MediaRecorder was not delivering audio chunks during recording.

**Root Cause**: Missing `timeslice` parameter in `mediaRecorder.start()`

**Impact**: 
- Only captured final ~1458 bytes instead of ~250KB for 5 seconds
- Whisper STT received incomplete audio
- Resulted in hallucinated/incorrect transcriptions

---

## ✅ The Fix

### **Changed 2 lines in `voiceCallService.ts`:**

**Line 120:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
this.mediaRecorder.start();

// AFTER:
this.mediaRecorder.start(100); // Deliver chunks every 100ms
```

**Line 131:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
this.mediaRecorder.start();

// AFTER:
this.mediaRecorder.start(100); // Deliver chunks every 100ms
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Audio captured: ~1458 bytes (0.1 seconds)
- STT receives: Tiny fragment
- Transcription: Random/hallucinated words
- User says: "What did I ask you before?"
- Atlas hears: "you"

### **After Fix:**
- Audio captured: ~250KB (full 5 seconds)
- STT receives: Complete audio
- Transcription: Accurate full sentence
- User says: "What did I ask you before?"
- Atlas hears: "What did I ask you before?"

## 🎯 How MediaRecorder Timeslice Works

```typescript
// WITHOUT timeslice:
mediaRecorder.start();
// → Accumulates ALL audio in memory
// → Delivers data ONLY when stop() is called
// → BUT: Browser may discard data during long recordings

// WITH timeslice (100ms):
mediaRecorder.start(100);
// → Delivers chunks every 100ms to ondataavailable
// → Chunks accumulate in audioChunks array
// → When stop() called, all chunks are available
// → Creates complete audio blob
```

## 🧪 Test Instructions

1. **Reload browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Start voice call**
3. **Speak clearly for 5 seconds**: "Hello Atlas, my name is Jason and I want to test the voice feature"
4. **Watch console**: Should see `Processing voice chunk: ~250000 bytes` (not 1458!)
5. **Verify transcription**: Should match what you said exactly
6. **Continue conversation**: Ask follow-up question to test memory
