# 🎯 Navigate to Project Delete (Not Team Settings)

## **Current Issue**
You're on: **Team Settings** (`~/settings/general`)
You need: **Project Settings** (`atlas-8h6x/settings/general`)

---

## **Steps to Fix**

### **Option 1: Use URL Directly**
Change the URL from:
```
vercel.com/jason-carelses-projects/~/settings/general
```

To:
```
vercel.com/jason-carelses-projects/atlas-8h6x/settings/general
```

### **Option 2: Navigate Through UI**

1. **Click "Projects"** in the top navigation bar (or go back to dashboard)
2. **Find and click `atlas-8h6x`** project
3. **Click "Settings"** tab
4. **Click "General"** in the left sidebar
5. **Scroll to bottom** → Find "Delete Project"

---

## **Key Difference**

**Team Settings** (`~/settings/general`):
- Shows "Team Name", "Team URL"
- Left sidebar: General, Billing, Build and Deployment, Invoices, Members, etc.
- ❌ **Can't delete project here**

**Project Settings** (`atlas-8h6x/settings/general`):
- Shows project-specific settings
- Left sidebar: General, Build and Deployment, Environments, Git, etc.
- ✅ **Delete Project option is here** (at bottom)

---

## **After Navigating to Project Settings**

1. Scroll to the **very bottom** of the General page
2. Look for **"Delete Project"** section (red/danger zone)
3. Click **"Delete Project"**
4. Type `atlas-8h6x` to confirm
5. Click final **"Delete"** button

---

**Quick Fix:** Just change `~/settings/general` to `atlas-8h6x/settings/general` in the URL bar.
