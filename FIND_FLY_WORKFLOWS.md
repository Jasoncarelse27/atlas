# üîç Finding Fly.io Workflows in GitHub Actions

**You're on:** GitHub Actions page  
**Looking for:** "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io" and "Test Fly.io Secret" workflows

---

## üìç **Where to Find Them:**

### **Option 1: Left Sidebar**

**Scroll down** in the left sidebar under "All workflows" - they should appear there:
- "Deploy Voice V2 to Fly.io"
- "Test Fly.io Secret"

**If you don't see them:**
- They might need to be committed/pushed first
- Or GitHub needs to refresh (try refreshing the page)

---

### **Option 2: Search**

**Use the search bar** at the top:
- Type: "Fly" or "fly"
- Should show both workflows

---

### **Option 3: Filter**

**Click "Filter workflow runs"** and search for:
- "fly"
- "voice-v2"
- "deploy"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **If Workflows Don't Appear:**

### **They Need to Be Committed:**

The workflows I created might not be committed yet. Let me check:

**Files to commit:**
- `.github/workflows/fly-io-deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test-fly-secret.yml`

**If not committed:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/fly-io-deploy.yml .github/workflows/test-fly-secret.yml
git commit -m "feat: add Fly.io deployment workflows"
git push origin main
```

**Then refresh GitHub Actions page** - workflows will appear!

---

## üéØ **Quick Check:**

**In your terminal, run:**
```bash
ls .github/workflows/*fly*
```

**Should show:**
- `fly-io-deploy.yml`
- `test-fly-secret.yml`

**If files exist but don't show in GitHub:**
- They need to be committed and pushed

---

## ‚úÖ **After Committing:**

1. **Refresh:** GitHub Actions page
2. **Look for:** Workflows in left sidebar
3. **Click:** "Run workflow" to test

---

**Check if the workflow files exist - if they do, we need to commit them!** üìù
