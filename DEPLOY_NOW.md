# ðŸš€ QUICK PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

## Option 1: Run the Deploy Script (Easiest)

```bash
# 1. Check what's changed
git status

# 2. Add all changes
git add -A

git commit -m "feat: enterprise monitoring live - Sentry + performance tracking ready for production"

# 4. Push (triggers deployment)
git push origin main
```
