# 🎯 What's Next for Atlas

**Last Updated:** October 26, 2024, 8:50 PM  
**Current Focus:** Voice V2 Development

---

## 🚀 Immediate Priority: Voice V2 (Weeks 1-8)

### **Decision Made:**
✅ **Build V2 voice chat properly** (don't ship V1)

**Why:**
- V1 latency: 31 seconds (unshippable)
- User feedback: "Feels like a cheap voice note system"
- V2 target: < 2 seconds (ChatGPT competitive)

**Documentation:**
- 📄 `VOICE_V2_KICKOFF_SUMMARY.md` - Project overview
- 📄 `docs/VOICE_V2_PROJECT_PLAN.md` - 8-week plan
- 📄 `docs/VOICE_V2_TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` - Implementation details
- 📄 `docs/VOICE_V2_ROADMAP.md` - High-level timeline

## 📅 Week 1 Tasks (Nov 1-8)

### **Foundation Setup:**
- [ ] Install dependencies (Deepgram SDK, PlayHT SDK)
- [ ] Create basic WebSocket echo test
- [ ] Implement Edge Function skeleton (`/api/voice-v2`)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create project board (GitHub Projects)
- [ ] Schedule daily standups
- [ ] Create Slack channel: #voice-v2

**Goal:** Working WebSocket connection (client ←→ Edge)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### **V2 Stack:**
```
Client (WebAudio) ←→ Vercel Edge (WebSocket) ←→ Streaming APIs
      ↓                        ↓                       ↓
  Microphone             Session Manager        Deepgram Stream
      ↓                        ↓                       ↓
  AudioWorklet           Audio Queue            Claude Realtime
      ↓                        ↓                       ↓
  Speakers                Metrics Logger         PlayHT Stream

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### **Daily Routine:**
1. **10am:** Daily standup (15 min)
2. **Work on Week N tasks** (see project plan)
3. **Update progress** in #voice-v2 Slack
4. **Document blockers** immediately
5. **Git commit** at end of day

### **Weekly Routine:**
1. **Friday 2pm:** Weekly review (1 hour)
2. **Demo progress** to team
3. **Update project board**
4. **Plan next week's tasks**

## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### **Current Blockers:**
- None (Week 1 ready to start)

### **Potential Risks:**
1. **Edge Function WebSocket limits**
   - Mitigation: Test with 100 concurrent connections
   - Fallback: Fly.io if needed

2. **Streaming API reliability**
   - Mitigation: Retry logic, health checks
   - Fallback: Graceful degradation

3. **Timeline slip**
   - Mitigation: Weekly reviews, MVP-first approach
   - Buffer: 2 weeks built into 8-week plan

## 🎓 Lessons from V1

### **What We Learned:**
1. ❌ REST APIs can't do real-time (31s latency)
2. ❌ Railway has cold starts (inconsistent performance)
3. ❌ Sequential processing is slow (STT → LLM → TTS)
4. ❌ "Good enough" isn't good enough (users expect ChatGPT quality)

### **What We're Doing in V2:**
1. ✅ WebSocket streaming (parallel processing)
2. ✅ Vercel Edge Functions (no cold starts)
3. ✅ Pipelined architecture (< 2s latency)
4. ✅ Ship when it's great (no Beta labels)
