# Atlas Mobile Development Log

## Issue Resolution (2024-07-18)

### Problem
- Tunnel endpoint went offline
- Error: "HTTP response error 404: The endpoint z9qfvgs-anonymous-8081.exp.direct is offline"
- Error code: ERR_NGROK_3200

### Root Cause
- Expo tunnel connection became unstable
- Network connectivity issues between local development server and tunnel

### Solution Applied
1. Killed all existing Expo processes: `pkill -f "expo start"`
2. Restarted tunnel with clear cache: `npx expo start --tunnel --clear`
3. New tunnel endpoint created successfully

### Current Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Tunnel is connected and working
- New URL: `exp://z9qfvgs-anonymous-8081.exp.direct`
- QR code is available for iPhone testing
- Development server is running on port 8081

### Testing Instructions
1. Scan QR code with iPhone Camera app
2. Or use Expo Go app to scan QR code
3. Atlas mobile app should load successfully

### Prevention
- Use `--clear` flag when restarting tunnel
- Monitor tunnel connection status
- Have backup testing methods (web browser, iOS simulator)
