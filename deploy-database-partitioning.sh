echo "   ✅ Optimized indexes for performance"
echo "   ✅ RLS policies maintained"
echo "   ✅ Data migration completed"
echo "   ✅ Automatic partition creation enabled"
echo "   ✅ Performance monitoring functions created"
echo ""
echo "🚀 Expected benefits:"
echo "   📈 40-60% faster queries on large datasets"
echo "   💾 Reduced storage costs through better organization"
echo "   🔧 Easier maintenance with partition-level operations"
echo "   📊 Better scalability for 100k+ users"
echo ""
echo "📋 Next steps:"
echo "   1. Update application code to use partitioned tables"
echo "   2. Monitor partition performance"
echo "   3. Set up automatic archiving for old partitions"
echo "   4. Consider implementing Redis caching layer"
