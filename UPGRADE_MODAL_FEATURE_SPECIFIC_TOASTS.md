## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **UpgradeModal Component Updates**
```typescript
// New props for enhanced functionality
interface UpgradeModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  feature: 'voice' | 'image';
  onUpgrade?: () => void;
  onUpgradeSuccess?: () => void; // NEW: Auto-trigger callback
  userTier?: 'free' | 'core' | 'studio'; // NEW: Current tier
}
```

### **Feature-Specific Toast Logic**
```typescript
// Smart tier determination based on feature
const targetTier = feature === 'voice' ? 'core' : 'studio';

// Personalized messages
const featureMessage = feature === "voice"
  ? "You can now record and transcribe voice messages 🎤"
  : feature === "image"
  ? "You can now upload and analyze images 🖼️"
  : "Your premium features are unlocked ✨";
```

### **Auto-Trigger Implementation**
```typescript
onUpgradeSuccess={() => {
  if (upgradeFeature === 'voice') {
    // Auto-trigger voice recording
    setExpanded(true);
    setTimeout(() => {
      setShowVoiceInput(true);
      setExpanded(false);
    }, 100);
  } else if (upgradeFeature === 'image') {
    // Auto-trigger image upload
    setExpanded(true);
    setTimeout(() => {
      handleImageUpload();
      setExpanded(false);
    }, 100);
  }
}}
```
