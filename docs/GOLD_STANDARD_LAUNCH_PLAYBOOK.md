# Atlas AI Gold Standard Launch Playbook

## 🎯 Mission Statement

This playbook ensures **100% production readiness** for Atlas AI deployments through systematic validation, monitoring, and quality gates.

## 🚦 Core Principle

> **Core Validation = BLOCKING** (TypeScript, ESLint, Unit Tests, Build)  
> **E2E Validation = NON-BLOCKING** (Playwright UX/Browser)  
> **Monitoring = ALWAYS ON**

This balance ensures safety, speed, and scalability.

---

## 📋 1. Pre-Flight Checks

**Before touching production:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

**✅ Ensures your local environment is clean and up-to-date.**

---

## 🔒 2. Staging Validation (BLOCKING)

**Run full staging validation (blocks unsafe deployments):**

```bash
./scripts/staging-validation.sh
```

**Checks:**
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- ✅ Unit Tests: 100% pass
- ✅ Build: successful

**⚠️ If any fail → STOP and fix before continuing.**

---

## 🌐 3. E2E Validation (NON-BLOCKING)

**Run cross-browser & mobile tests separately:**

```bash
./scripts/playwright-validation.sh
```

**Covers:**
- ✅ Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- ✅ iOS & Android responsiveness
- ✅ Vitest conflict handled gracefully (non-blocking)

**ℹ️ Results logged for UX review, but don't block deployment.**

---

## 📊 4. Monitoring & Infrastructure Check

**Ensure observability is live:**
- ✅ **Sentry** (error tracking)
- ✅ **Supabase** (DB + Auth monitoring)
- ✅ **Railway** (services health)
- ✅ **Vercel** (deployment health)

---

## 🏷️ 5. Commit & Tag Release

**Bundle all changes into one clean commit:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: finalize Atlas AI vX.X.X production baseline 🚀"
git push origin main
```

**Then tag the release:**

```bash
git tag vX.X.X
git push origin vX.X.X
```

---

## 🚀 6. Production Deployment

**Run final validation + deployment:**

```bash
./scripts/staging-validation.sh && ./scripts/playwright-validation.sh
```

**✅ Confirms core blocking checks**  
**✅ Logs non-blocking E2E UX checks**  
**✅ Pushes final build to production**

---

## 🔍 7. Post-Deployment Verification

**Review logs in:**
- ✅ **Vercel Dashboard** (deployment health)
- ✅ **Sentry** (error signals)
- ✅ **Supabase** (database/API health)
- ✅ **Railway** (service monitoring)

---

## 🔄 8. Next Steps for Continuous Improvement

- ✅ **Deploy with confidence** → Core validation is the gatekeeper
- ✅ **Review E2E UX results** → Feed improvements into backlog
- ✅ **Scale infra** → Expand monitoring as traffic grows
- ✅ **Integrate user feedback** → Production-ready for real-world testing

## 🛠️ Scripts Reference

### Core Validation Script
```bash
./scripts/staging-validation.sh
```
**Purpose:** Blocks unsafe deployments  
**Exit Code:** 1 if any core check fails

### E2E Validation Script
```bash
./scripts/playwright-validation.sh
```
**Purpose:** UX/browser compatibility review  
**Exit Code:** 0 (always passes, logs issues for review)

### Production Promotion Script
```bash
./scripts/promote-production.sh
```
**Purpose:** Full production deployment pipeline  
**Includes:** CLI checks, monitoring verification, deployment

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Core Validation Fails
1. **STOP** all deployment activities
2. **Fix** the blocking issue (TypeScript/ESLint/Test/Build)
3. **Re-run** `./scripts/staging-validation.sh`
4. **Continue** only after all checks pass

### If E2E Validation Fails
1. **Log** the issue for UX review
2. **Continue** with deployment (non-blocking)
3. **Schedule** E2E fix in next sprint
4. **Monitor** user feedback for related issues

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Deployment Success
- ✅ **0 TypeScript errors**
- ✅ **0 ESLint errors/warnings**
- ✅ **100% unit test pass rate**
- ✅ **Successful production build**

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ **< 5% error rate** (Sentry)
- ✅ **< 2s page load time** (Vercel)
- ✅ **> 99% uptime** (Railway)
- ✅ **Clean database queries** (Supabase)
