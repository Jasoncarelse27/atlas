# Atlas AI Gold Standard Launch Playbook

## 🎯 Mission Statement

This playbook ensures **100% production readiness** for Atlas AI deployments through systematic validation, monitoring, and quality gates.

## 🚦 Core Principle

> **Core Validation = BLOCKING** (TypeScript, ESLint, Unit Tests, Build)  
> **E2E Validation = NON-BLOCKING** (Playwright UX/Browser)  
> **Monitoring = ALWAYS ON**

This balance ensures safety, speed, and scalability.

## 🎯 Validation Scope: Staging vs Production

### 📝 **Staging Validation (COMPREHENSIVE)**
**Trigger:** Push to `main` or `develop` branches  
**Goal:** Maximum coverage, no shortcuts - catch all possible issues before production  
**Script:** `./scripts/staging-validation.sh`

**Includes:**
- ✅ **Core Validation (BLOCKING)**
  - TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
  - ESLint linting (0 warnings)
  - Unit tests (100% pass rate)
  - Production build (successful)
- ✅ **Extended Validation (STAGING COMPREHENSIVE)**
  - Playwright E2E cross-browser tests
  - MailerLite webhook validation (dummy secrets)
  - Supabase integration tests (mocked)
  - Authentication flow validation
  - Performance & bundle analysis
  - Security audit (moderate level)
  - Code coverage analysis

### 🚀 **Production Validation (CRITICAL ONLY)**
**Trigger:** Release tags (`v*`)  
**Goal:** Fast deploys, only mission-critical blockers  
**Script:** `./scripts/production-critical-validation.sh`

**Includes:**
- ✅ **Critical Validation (BLOCKING ONLY)**
  - TypeScript compilation (0 errors)
  - ESLint linting (0 warnings)
  - Unit tests (100% pass rate)
  - Production build (successful)
  - Health check validation
  - Security audit (high level only)

**Excludes:**
- ❌ Playwright E2E tests (non-blocking)
- ❌ MailerLite webhook tests
- ❌ Performance analysis
- ❌ Code coverage reports

### 🌐 **E2E Validation (ALWAYS NON-BLOCKING)**
**Trigger:** All workflows  
**Goal:** Upload results for review, never block production deployment  
**Script:** `./scripts/playwright-validation.sh`

**Includes:**
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness (iOS & Android)
- ✅ Chat functionality smoke tests
- ✅ Authentication flow validation
- ✅ Artifact uploads for review

**Status:** **NON-BLOCKING** - failures do not prevent deployment

---

## 📋 1. Pre-Flight Checks

**Before touching production:**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

**✅ Ensures your local environment is clean and up-to-date.**

---

## 🔒 2. Staging Validation (COMPREHENSIVE)

**Run comprehensive staging validation (blocks unsafe deployments):**

```bash
./scripts/staging-validation.sh
```

**Core Validation (BLOCKING):**
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- ✅ Unit Tests: 100% pass
- ✅ Build: successful

**Extended Validation (STAGING COMPREHENSIVE):**
- ✅ Playwright E2E cross-browser tests
- ✅ MailerLite webhook validation (dummy secrets)
- ✅ Supabase integration tests (mocked)
- ✅ Authentication flow validation
- ✅ Performance & bundle analysis
- ✅ Security audit (moderate level)
- ✅ Code coverage analysis

**⚠️ If any CORE validation fails → STOP and fix before continuing.**  
**⚠️ Extended validation warnings should be reviewed but don't block staging.**

---

## 🌐 3. E2E Validation (NON-BLOCKING)

**Run cross-browser & mobile tests separately:**

```bash
./scripts/playwright-validation.sh
```

**Covers:**
- ✅ Chrome, Safari, Firefox
- ✅ iOS & Android responsiveness
- ✅ Vitest conflict handled gracefully (non-blocking)

**ℹ️ Results logged for UX review, but don't block deployment.**

---

## 📊 4. Monitoring & Infrastructure Check

**Ensure observability is live:**
- ✅ **Sentry** (error tracking)
- ✅ **Supabase** (DB + Auth monitoring)
- ✅ **Railway** (services health)
- ✅ **Vercel** (deployment health)

---

## 🏷️ 5. Production Deployment (CRITICAL ONLY)

**Production deployment runs only critical blocking checks:**

```bash
git tag vX.X.X -m "Atlas AI vX.X.X Production Release"
git push origin vX.X.X
```

**Production Critical Validation (BLOCKING ONLY):**
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: 0 warnings  
- ✅ Unit Tests: 100% pass
- ✅ Production Build: successful
- ✅ Health Check: endpoints validated
- ✅ Security Audit: high-level vulnerabilities only

**Excluded from Production (Non-blocking):**
- ❌ Playwright E2E tests
- ❌ MailerLite webhook tests
- ❌ Performance analysis
- ❌ Code coverage reports

**Goal:** Fast deploys, only mission-critical blockers

---

## 🚀 6. Production Deployment

**Run final validation + deployment:**

```bash
./scripts/staging-validation.sh && ./scripts/playwright-validation.sh
```

**✅ Confirms core blocking checks**  
**✅ Logs non-blocking E2E UX checks**  
**✅ Pushes final build to production**

---

## 🔍 7. Post-Deployment Verification

**Review logs in:**
- ✅ **Vercel Dashboard** (deployment health)
- ✅ **Sentry** (error signals)
- ✅ **Supabase** (database/API health)
- ✅ **Railway** (service monitoring)

---

## 🔄 8. Next Steps for Continuous Improvement

- ✅ **Deploy with confidence** → Core validation is the gatekeeper
- ✅ **Review E2E UX results** → Feed improvements into backlog
- ✅ **Scale infra** → Expand monitoring as traffic grows
- ✅ **Integrate user feedback** → Production-ready for real-world testing

## 🛠️ Scripts Reference

### Core Validation Script
```bash
./scripts/staging-validation.sh
```
**Purpose:** Blocks unsafe deployments  
**Exit Code:** 1 if any core check fails

### E2E Validation Script
```bash
./scripts/playwright-validation.sh
```
**Purpose:** UX/browser compatibility review  
**Exit Code:** 0 (always passes, logs issues for review)

### Production Promotion Script
```bash
./scripts/promote-production.sh
```
**Purpose:** Full production deployment pipeline  
**Includes:** CLI checks, monitoring verification, deployment

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Core Validation Fails
1. **STOP** all deployment activities
2. **Fix** the blocking issue (TypeScript/ESLint/Test/Build)
3. **Re-run** `./scripts/staging-validation.sh`
4. **Continue** only after all checks pass

### If E2E Validation Fails
1. **Log** the issue for UX review
2. **Continue** with deployment (non-blocking)
3. **Schedule** E2E fix in next sprint
4. **Monitor** user feedback for related issues
