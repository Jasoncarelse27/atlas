## 🔧 Critical Fixes Included

### **Memory Leak Fixes**
- ✅ All `setTimeout` calls tracked in `pendingTimeouts` Set
- ✅ All timeouts cleared on `stopCall()`
- ✅ AbortController timeouts properly managed
- ✅ Intervals tracked and cleared

### **Global State Cleanup**
- ✅ `__atlasAudioElement` cleaned up in all error paths
- ✅ Audio elements properly disposed

### **Memory Issue Fix**
- ✅ Voice calls now use full conversation history (not just current session)
- ✅ Backend loads last 10 messages for Core/Studio tiers
- ✅ Removed frontend `context` override that limited memory

## 📊 Code Metrics

### **Before Extraction**
- **voiceCallService.ts**: 2,090 lines
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Very High
- **Responsibilities**: 9+ distinct services
- **Testability**: Low (monolithic)
- **Maintainability**: Low

### **After Extraction**
- **voiceCallService.ts**: ~2,200 lines (with feature flags, but cleaner)
- **Service Files**: 9 focused services (~50-150 lines each)
- **Total Lines**: ~1,200 lines across services
- **Testability**: High (isolated services)
- **Maintainability**: High (single responsibility)

---

## 🚀 Feature Flags

All services are behind feature flags for safe rollout:

```typescript
// .env.local
VITE_USE_NETWORK_MONITORING_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_RETRY_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_MESSAGE_PERSISTENCE_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_AUDIO_PLAYBACK_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_VAD_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_STT_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_TTS_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_CALL_LIFECYCLE_SERVICE=true
VITE_USE_TIMEOUT_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE=true
```

**Rollout Strategy:**
1. ✅ All services ready for testing
2. Enable one service at a time in production
3. Monitor for 24-48 hours per service
4. Enable next service if no issues
5. Remove legacy code after all services stable
