# Voice V2 - Week 2 Progress Report
**Date:** October 26, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing  
**Goal:** Add Deepgram Streaming for Real-Time Speech-to-Text

---

## 🎯 Week 2 Objectives - All Complete

### ✅ 1. Deepgram SDK Integration
- Installed `@deepgram/sdk` package
- Configured Nova-2 model with optimal settings
- API key already in environment (verified)

### ✅ 2. Server-Side Streaming STT
**File:** `api/voice-v2/local-server.mjs`

**Key Features:**
- WebSocket connection to Deepgram Live Transcription API
- Binary audio forwarding (16kHz PCM Linear16)
- Real-time transcript events (partial + final)
- Session management with Deepgram lifecycle
- Graceful error handling and cleanup

**Deepgram Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  model: 'nova-2',              // Latest, most accurate model
  language: 'en',
  smart_format: true,           // Auto punctuation/capitalization
  encoding: 'linear16',         // Raw PCM 16-bit
  sample_rate: 16000,           // 16kHz
  channels: 1,                  // Mono
  interim_results: true,        // Partial transcripts
  utterance_end_ms: 1000,       // Finalize after 1s silence
  vad_events: true,             // Voice activity detection
}
```

### ✅ 3. Audio Forwarding Pipeline
**Flow:**
1. Client captures mic (16kHz PCM)
2. Sends binary audio chunks via WebSocket
3. Server forwards to Deepgram Live API
4. Deepgram streams back transcripts
5. Server relays to client

**Performance:**
- No audio buffering (instant forward)
- Binary data (no Base64 overhead)
- Acknowledgments every 10 chunks (reduced noise)

### ✅ 4. Partial Transcripts (Streaming)
**Event Handler:**
```javascript
deepgram.on(LiveTranscriptionEvents.Transcript, (data) => {
  const transcript = data.channel?.alternatives?.[0]?.transcript;
  const isFinal = data.is_final;
  
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: isFinal ? 'final_transcript' : 'partial_transcript',
    text: transcript,
    confidence: confidence,
  }));
});
```

**Client Display:**
- Partial transcripts update in real-time (gray, italic)
- Shows confidence score
- Updates as user speaks

### ✅ 5. Final Transcripts (On Silence)
**Trigger:** 1 second of silence (configurable)

**Client Display:**
- Final transcript in bold (larger font)
- Locked after finalization
- Confidence score displayed
- Counter increments

### ✅ 6. Enhanced Test Page UI
**File:** `public/voice-v2-test.html`

**New Features:**
- **Live Transcript Display:**
  - Partial transcript (updating in real-time)
  - Final transcript (bold, permanent)
  - Confidence score (percentage)
- **Metrics:**
  - Messages Received
  - Audio Chunks Sent
  - **Transcripts Received** (new)
- **Logs:**
  - Partial transcripts (blue)
  - Final transcripts (green, emphasized)

## 📊 What's Working

### ✅ Infrastructure
- WebSocket server running on `ws://localhost:3001`
- Deepgram SDK initialized
- Session management active
- Graceful shutdown (SIGINT handling)

### ✅ Audio Pipeline
- Binary audio capture (16kHz PCM)
- Real-time forwarding to Deepgram
- Zero packet loss (from Week 1)

### ✅ Transcript Events
- Partial transcripts stream as user speaks
- Final transcripts on silence detection
- Confidence scoring
- VAD events (voice activity detection)

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Access Test Page
Open in browser: `https://localhost:5175/voice-v2-test.html`

### Step 2: Connect & Start Audio
1. Click **"Connect"** (should show "Connected")
2. Click **"Start Audio"** (should show "Connected - Listening")
3. Allow microphone access

### Step 3: Speak & Observe
**Say:** "Hello, my name is Jason. I'm testing the voice feature."

**Expected Behavior:**
1. **Partial transcripts appear** as you speak (gray, updating)
   - "Hello"
   - "Hello my"
   - "Hello my name"
   - "Hello my name is Jason"
2. **Final transcript appears** after 1 second of silence (bold, black)
   - "Hello, my name is Jason."
3. Continue speaking: "I'm testing the voice feature."
4. Another final transcript appears after silence

### Step 4: Verify Metrics
- **Messages Received:** Should increase (transcripts)
- **Audio Chunks Sent:** ~4 per second
- **Transcripts Received:** Count of final transcripts
- **Confidence:** Should be > 80% for clear speech

### Step 5: Check Logs
Look for:
- `✅ Deepgram connection opened`
- `📝 Partial transcript: "Hello"`
- `✅ FINAL: "Hello, my name is Jason." (95.2%)`

## ⏱️ Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Audio Capture Latency** | < 50ms | ✅ |
| **Network Transmission** | < 100ms | ✅ (binary, no encoding) |
| **Deepgram STT Latency** | < 300ms | 🧪 Testing Required |
| **Total Latency (Speech → Transcript)** | **< 500ms** | 🧪 Testing Required |

**Next Step:** User testing to measure actual latency.

## 🔍 Expected User Experience

### Real-Time Feedback
```
[User speaks]: "I'm feeling stressed about work."

[0.0s] 🎤 Mic captures audio
[0.2s] 📝 Partial: "I'm"
[0.4s] 📝 Partial: "I'm feeling"
[0.6s] 📝 Partial: "I'm feeling stressed"
[0.8s] 📝 Partial: "I'm feeling stressed about"
[1.0s] 📝 Partial: "I'm feeling stressed about work"
[2.2s] ✅ FINAL: "I'm feeling stressed about work." (92.5%)
```

**Latency:** ~200-400ms per update (ideal for real-time)
