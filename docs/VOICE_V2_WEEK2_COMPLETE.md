## 🎯 What We Built (Week 2)

### 1. **Deepgram SDK Integration** ✅
- Installed `@deepgram/sdk`
- Configured Nova-2 model
- Streaming WebSocket to Deepgram Live API

### 2. **Server-Side Audio Forwarding** ✅
**File:** `api/voice-v2/local-server.mjs`

**Features:**
- Binary audio forwarding (16kHz PCM → Deepgram)
- Real-time transcript events (partial + final)
- Session management with lifecycle tracking
- Error handling and graceful cleanup

**Deepgram Config:**
```javascript
{
  model: 'nova-2',              // Most accurate
  encoding: 'linear16',         // Raw PCM
  sample_rate: 16000,           // 16kHz
  interim_results: true,        // Streaming partials
  utterance_end_ms: 1000,       // Finalize after 1s silence
  smart_format: true,           // Auto punctuation
}
```

### 3. **Real-Time Transcription Pipeline** ✅
**Flow:**
1. User speaks → Mic captures (16kHz PCM)
2. Client sends binary audio via WebSocket
3. Server forwards to Deepgram Live
4. Deepgram streams back transcripts (partial + final)
5. Server relays to client
6. UI updates in real-time

### 4. **Enhanced Test UI** ✅
**File:** `public/voice-v2-test.html`

**New Features:**
- Live transcript display (partial + final)
- Confidence scoring (%)
- Transcript counter
- Real-time updates as user speaks
- Clean visual feedback
