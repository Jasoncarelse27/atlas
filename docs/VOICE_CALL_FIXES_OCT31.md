# Voice Call Fixes - October 31, 2025

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXES APPLIED - Ready for Testing**

---

## üî¥ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Excessive Auth State Logging ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Hundreds of "User signed in" logs flooding console

**Fix:**
- Prevent duplicate logs (only log once per event type)
- Changed to debug level (less spam)
- Track last logged event to prevent repeats

**File:** `src/hooks/useTierQuery.ts`

---

### Issue 2: Voice Call Ends Immediately ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Call starts but ends ~1 second later with no clear reason

**Fixes Applied:**

#### Fix 2a: Error Handler Too Aggressive
- **Before:** ANY error ended the call
- **After:** Only critical errors end call (permission denied, max duration)
- Non-critical errors show warning but keep call active

**File:** `src/components/modals/VoiceCallModal.tsx`

#### Fix 2b: Better Error Handling
- Added try-catch around VAD monitoring
- MediaRecorder errors don't end call (attempts recovery)
- Processing errors don't end call (restarts recording)

**File:** `src/services/voiceCallService.ts`

#### Fix 2c: Better Logging
- Log when `stopCall` is called
- Log when recording starts
- Log when VAD monitoring starts
- Log audio chunk processing

**Files:** `src/services/voiceCallService.ts`

## üìä Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `src/hooks/useTierQuery.ts` - Auth logging fix
2. `src/components/modals/VoiceCallModal.tsx` - Error handler fix
3. `src/services/voiceCallService.ts` - Error handling + logging

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Open voice call modal**
2. **Start call**
3. **Watch console logs:**
   - Should see: "Recording started, waiting for speech..."
   - Should see: "VAD monitoring started"
   - Should NOT see: "Stopping call..." immediately
   - If you see "Stopping call...", check the log BEFORE it to see why

4. **Speak into microphone**
   - Should see: "Processing audio chunk: X.X KB"
   - Should see transcript appear
   - Call should continue (not end)

5. **If call still ends immediately:**
   - Check console for error logs
   - Look for "Stopping call..." message
   - Check what happened right before it

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

**Before:**
- Call starts ‚Üí Call ends immediately
- Hundreds of auth logs
- No clear reason why

**After:**
- Call starts ‚Üí Waits for speech
- Only ends on critical errors
- Better error recovery
- Much less console spam

## üîç Debugging Tips

If call still ends immediately:

1. **Check console for:**
   - `[VoiceCall] üõë Stopping call...` - Shows when/why it ends
   - Any error messages before "Call ended"
   - "Stopping call..." message - tracks why

2. **Common causes:**
   - Permission denied (critical error - should end)
   - MediaRecorder error (should recover now)
   - VAD error (should continue now)
   - Modal closing (check if `isOpen` changes)

3. **Verify fixes:**
   - Non-critical errors should show warning (not end call)
   - MediaRecorder errors should attempt recovery
   - VAD errors should be caught and logged
