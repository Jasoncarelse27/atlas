## üîß Maintenance & Support

### **Monitoring Dashboard**
Create Supabase dashboard tracking:
- Daily voice feature usage (notes, calls, TTS)
- Average latency per feature
- Error rates (< 2% target)
- Cost per user per feature
- Tier-specific adoption rates

### **Support Runbook**
Common issues & resolutions:
1. **"Voice call not connecting"** ‚Üí Check mic permissions, HTTPS
2. **"Transcription is wrong"** ‚Üí Check audio quality, background noise
3. **"Call keeps dropping"** ‚Üí Railway cold start, implement keepalive
4. **"Response too slow"** ‚Üí Expected in V1 Beta, V2 coming Q1

### **Escalation Path**
- **Tier 1:** Support team (use runbook)
- **Tier 2:** Engineering on-call (critical outages)
- **Tier 3:** Product team (feature requests, UX issues)

## üéì Lessons & Best Practices

### **What Worked:**
1. **Tier gating** - Voice calls exclusive to Studio creates clear value prop
2. **VAD over push-to-talk** - Better UX for natural conversation
3. **Streaming responses** - Sentence-by-sentence TTS feels responsive
4. **Beta labeling** - Sets expectations, reduces negative feedback

### **What Didn't Work:**
1. **REST API for real-time** - 2.6s latency unacceptable, need streaming
2. **Railway for low-latency** - Cold starts kill performance
3. **Trying to match ChatGPT on V1** - Unrealistic without infrastructure change

### **Key Learnings:**
- **Ship incrementally:** V1 Beta ‚Üí V1.5 Streaming ‚Üí V2 WebSocket
- **Set expectations:** Beta label + response time = happy users
- **Monitor obsessively:** Latency, costs, adoption all need dashboards
- **Profit enables innovation:** 97.8% margin funds V2 development
