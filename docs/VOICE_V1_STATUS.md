## 🏗️ Architecture (V1)

### **Tech Stack:**
```
Client (React) → Railway Backend → API Services
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
  WebAudio         Express/Node    Deepgram REST
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
  VAD Logic         SSE Stream      Claude HTTP
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
  TTS Queue          Supabase       OpenAI TTS
```

### **Current Flow:**
1. User speaks → VAD detects silence (400ms)
2. Audio blob (webm/opus) → Base64 encoding
3. POST to `/api/stt-deepgram` with full audio file
4. Deepgram processes file → returns transcript (2.6s)
5. Transcript → Claude via `/api/message?stream=1`
6. Claude generates response via SSE (3.3s TTFB)
7. Sentence-by-sentence TTS generation
8. Progressive audio playback

### **Bottlenecks Identified:**
1. **Deepgram REST API** - Requires full audio upload (2.6s)
2. **Railway Cold Starts** - Backend wake-up time (~1-2s)
3. **Network Round-Trips** - localhost → Railway → APIs
4. **HTTP/SSE Overhead** - Connection establishment

## ✅ What's Working Well

### **1. Tier Enforcement**
- Voice calls exclusive to Studio tier ($189.99/month)
- Proper `useFeatureAccess('voice')` integration
- Upgrade modal triggers correctly

### **2. User Experience**
- Clean UI with real-time feedback
- Mic level visualization (12% shown in tests)
- Call duration tracking (unlimited for Studio)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space, Esc)

### **3. Error Handling**
- Permission checks (granted, denied, prompt)
- HTTPS requirement detection
- Timeout handling (5s STT, 10s Claude, 30s TTS)
- Graceful fallbacks

### **4. Conversation Buffer**
- Last 5 messages sent for context
- Proper message saving to Supabase
- Real-time sync disabled during calls

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### **1. Latency**
- **8.4 seconds** total response time (4x slower than ChatGPT)
- Deepgram confidence sometimes 0% on short audio
- Claude can take up to 41s on slow connections

### **2. Infrastructure**
- Railway free tier causes cold starts
- No connection pooling/keepalive
- HTTP overhead for each request

### **3. Edge Cases**
- Background noise can trigger false positives (VAD threshold: 26.9%)
- Short utterances (<5KB) sometimes skipped
- TTS timeout at 30s can fail on slow networks

## 🎯 V1 Shipping Strategy

### **Label as Beta**
Add to VoiceCallModal:
```tsx
<div className="bg-amber-50 border border-amber-200 rounded-lg p-3 mb-4">
  <p className="text-amber-800 text-sm">
    🎙️ <strong>Voice Chat (Beta)</strong>: Response times 5-10 seconds. 
    Real-time voice coming Q1 2025.
  </p>
</div>
```

### **Set Expectations**
- Document: "Studio feature in active development"
- Target audience: Early adopters willing to test
- Price point: $189.99/month = 5 users covers development cost

### **Monitor & Iterate**
- Track average response time per call
- Log failed transcriptions (confidence < 50%)
- Collect user feedback on latency tolerance

---

## 💡 Quick Wins Available

### **1. Deepgram Streaming (30 min, 2.1s improvement)**
Replace REST with WebSocket:
```typescript
// BEFORE: 2.6s
POST /api/stt-deepgram { audio: base64 }

// AFTER: 0.5s  
WebSocket wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen
ws.send(audioBlob)
```

### **2. Railway Keepalive (5 min, 1-2s improvement)**
```javascript
// Prevent cold starts
setInterval(() => fetch('/health'), 120000);
```

### **3. Use Claude 3.5 Haiku for Voice (Already Done!)**
- Model switched in backend
- 10x faster than Sonnet
- Already implemented ✅

### **Expected Result After Quick Wins:**
- 8.4s → **5-6 seconds** (still 2.5x ChatGPT, but acceptable for Beta)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **V1 Beta (Current Goal)**
- ✅ Ship working voice feature
- ✅ Studio tier exclusive
- ✅ < 10 second response time
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ⚠️ Set user expectations clearly

### **User Feedback Targets**
- 70%+ users find it "usable" despite latency
- < 5% call failure rate
- > 80% successful transcriptions (confidence > 50%)

### **Business Goal**
- Differentiate Studio tier from competitors
- Justify $189.99/month pricing
- Gather data for V2 improvements

---

## 🔒 Production Readiness

### **Security: ✅**
- Supabase auth validation
- Tier enforcement
- Rate limiting (500 calls/day for Studio)

### **Monitoring: ✅**
- Sentry error tracking
- Performance logging
- Token usage tracking

### **Scalability: ⚠️**
- Current: 5-10 concurrent users max (Railway limits)
- Bottleneck: Backend infrastructure
- Solution: V2 migration to Edge (see VOICE_V2_ROADMAP.md)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### **What Worked:**
1. Starting with VAD instead of push-to-talk
2. Streaming Claude responses (sentence-by-sentence TTS)
3. Using Haiku for voice (speed over quality)
4. Disabling background sync during calls

### **What Didn't:**
1. REST API for STT (too slow)
2. Railway backend (cold starts)
3. Trying to match ChatGPT speed on V1 infrastructure

### **Key Insight:**
**"Ship usable, iterate to perfect."** 
- 8.4s is 4x slower than ChatGPT but 6x faster than initial version
- Users will tolerate if expectations are set
- V2 can target ChatGPT-level performance with proper infrastructure

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Ship V1 Beta** (this week):
   - Add Beta label
   - Set expectations (5-10s response time)
   - Monitor usage

2. **Implement Quick Win** (next week):
   - Deepgram Streaming API
   - Target: 5-6s response time

3. **Plan V2** (Q1 2025):
   - See `VOICE_V2_ROADMAP.md`
   - Full WebSocket implementation
   - Edge deployment
   - Target: <2s (ChatGPT quality)
