## 📊 Post-Launch Monitoring

### Week 1 Metrics to Watch

**Conversion Funnel:**
```
Voice Button Clicks
  ↓
Modal Opens (Free/Core users)
  ↓
"Upgrade to Studio" Clicks
  ↓
FastSpring Checkout Starts
  ↓
Successful Subscriptions
```

**Key Metrics:**
- Modal open rate (% of voice button clicks)
- CTA click rate (% of modal opens)
- Conversion rate (% of CTA clicks → subscriptions)
- Average time on modal
- Bounce rate (close without action)
- Error rate (if any issues)

**Comparison Baseline:**
- Compare VoiceUpgradeModal vs EnhancedUpgradeModal
- Expected improvement: +30-50% conversion rate
- A/B test duration: 2 weeks minimum

### Analytics Events to Track

```javascript
// Track modal opens
analytics.track('voice_upgrade_modal_opened', {
  tier: 'free' | 'core',
  source: 'voice_button' | 'voice_call_modal'
});

// Track CTA clicks
analytics.track('voice_upgrade_cta_clicked', {
  tier: 'free' | 'core',
  time_on_modal: seconds
});

// Track conversions
analytics.track('studio_subscription_completed', {
  source: 'voice_upgrade_modal',
  tier_before: 'free' | 'core'
});
```
